As the price of installing solar has gotten less expensive, more homeowners are turning to it as a possible option for decreasing their energy bill. We want to make installing solar panels easy and understandable for anyone. Project Sunroof puts Google's expansive data in mapping and computing resources to use, helping calculate the best solar plan for you. Project Sunroof computes how much sunlight hits your roof in a year. It takes into account: Google's database of imagery and maps 3D modeling of your roof Shadows cast by nearby structures and trees All possible sun positions over the course of a year Historical cloud and temperature patterns that might affect solar energy production. Data is available state wise, city wise, county wise, census wise on https://www.google.com/get/sunroof.
